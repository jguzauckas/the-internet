# Section 4.1 - The Internet

## Vocabulary

A **computing device** is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors.

- We all use multiple computing devices each day.

A **computer network** is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.

- All of our desktops in this room are part of a computer network.

A **computing system** is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose.

- A computer network is a type of computing system.

## Network

A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a receiver) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver.

- Airdrop is one of the simplest forms of a network, it is just a direct connection from sender to receiver.

- Most other uses of phones involve multiple devices in between; like connecting to a router, sending through multiple servers on the internet, sending to a router that the receiver is connected to, then finally to the receiver.

Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver.

- This is easy for smaller networks, but on the scale of the internet this becomes an impressive feat.

## Bandwidth

The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time.

- You might often experience this when downloading larger files and it seems to download slowly, you’ve run into a bandwidth limitation. This is often the case if you ever have a video you are watching buffer!

Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second.

- We can use prefixes with bits to measure more information. For example, a kilobit is roughly 1,000 bits, a megabit is roughly 1,000 kilobits or 1,000,000 bits, and a gigabit is roughly 1,000 megabits, 1,000,000 kilobits, or 1,000,000,000 bits. So gigabit internet is 1 billion bits transferred per second.

- Most internet connections in homes are on the order of tens to hundreds of megabits per second! For context, watching an HD YouTube video requires an estimated 5 megabits per second.

## Protocols

The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that uses standardized, open (nonproprietary) communication protocols.

- This allows for wide-access!

Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an Internet-connected device.

- This might seem like common sense, but it’s important to note that the devices that allow you to connect to the internet, like routers, require a lot of intentional design to function. 

A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.

- In our school, the grading policy of 80% assessments and 20% practice is a protocol, as it specifies the behavior of assigning grades.

The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.

- Most importantly, any users, not just a select few!

## Scalability

Routing on the internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.

- This allows the internet to better adapt as things happen.

The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands.

- Becomes more important for larger systems, or as smaller systems grow larger. 
- Creates a more positive experience for various groups.

The Internet was designed to be scalable.

- If the Internet wasn’t designed to be scalable, we’d still be struggling with very limited bandwidth, which would essentially keep us back decades, and things like TikTok would be crazy to try and implement.

## Packets

Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets.

Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly.

- Data reassembly is important as when we compress data to transmit it, as it would not be as easy to read anymore.

Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all.

- The metadata for packets involves information to help a computer identify the order they should be read, and helps to determine if packets are lost.

IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet.

- Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

## World Wide Web

The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files.

- Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are a way for us to tell the World Wide Web which resource we would like to go to.

HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web.

- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the chosen implementation for communication by the World Wide Web.

The World Wide Web uses the Internet.

- As strange as it is, they are two separate thing, the Internet is the network of devices and the World Wide Web uses that network to communicate, share, and compute information.

## Work

For the following situations, write down whether you think they describe a computing device, network, and/or system and why:

Two phones using FaceTime with each other - 

A laptop being used to code in Python - 

Your home wifi network - 

Watching a YouTube video on your phone - 

Choose three of the following sources (two beginner and one advanced) to learn from about the Internet. After going through each source, write 3 sentences about what you thought was interesting about it.

Sample Response:

[Crash Course Computer Science - Data Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtDxDvCpPL4) - I thought it was interesting how you combine three primary colors in proportions to create other colors. The fact that you don't need to save every single pixel's color to recreate an image with a lot of accuracy seems counterintuitive. Comparing frames of videos seems like an intuitive way to determine what information is redundant in a video.
